## Motivations behind the project

The main motivation behind this project is to provide a simple and easy-to-use tool for working with design tokens.
There are already a lot of great tools for this purpose (such as [style-dictionary](https://www.npmjs.com/package/style-dictionary) or [theo](https://www.npmjs.com/package/theo)), but they are either too complex or outdated.
I wanted to create a tool that will get your design tokens ready to use in a few seconds without any additional configuration.
However, if you want to extend its functionalities, you can do it easily by adding custom loaders, transforms, formats, validators, etc.
The goal is also to be align with latest DTCG Format and provide built-in support for it.
