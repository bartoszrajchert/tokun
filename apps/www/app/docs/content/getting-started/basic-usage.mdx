# Installation

Installation is not required to use tokun — simply, you can run it via CLI:

```bash
npx tokun
```
But if you want to use it as a library, you can install it as a dev dependency in your NPM package:

```bash
npm install -D tokun
```

However, if you want to use this package directly in an application, then install this as a regular dependency:

```bash
npm install tokun
```
