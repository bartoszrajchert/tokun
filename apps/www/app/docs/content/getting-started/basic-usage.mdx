# Installation

Installation is not required to use Tokun â€” simply, you can run it via `npx`:

```bash
npx tokun
```
But if you want to use it as a library, you can install it as a dev dependency in your NPM package:

```bash
npm install -D tokun
```

However, if you want to use this package directly in an application (not only internally), then install it as a regular dependency:

```bash
npm install tokun
```
