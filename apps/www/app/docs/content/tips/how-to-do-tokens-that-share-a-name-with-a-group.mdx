# How to do tokens that share a name with a group

This is the exact question asked in [#97 issue](https://github.com/design-tokens/community-group/issues/97) on DTSG repository.

## The solution

The DTSG is not yet aligned (12/04/2024 version) about this topic. You can follow the issue on GitHub.
However, Tokun is giving you an ability to create such token by defining empty key (`""`). See an example below:

```json
{
  "color": {
    "": {
      "$type": "color",
      "$value": "#123456",
      "$description": "Default color"
    },
    "primary": {
      "$type": "color",
      "$value": "#FFFFFF",
      "$description": "Primary color"
    }
  }
}
```

This JSON will generate 2 tokens:

- `color`
- `color.primary`
